Order Collection & WhatsApp Excel Workflow
When a user browses the Store and adds multiple products from different categories (for example perfumes, accessories, cartons, etc.), the website will not process online payments.

Instead, once the user clicks the 'Done' or 'Submit Order' button:
- The system automatically generates an Excel file.
- The Excel file contains full order details, including:
  • Category name
  • Product name
  • Quantity (pieces or cartons)
  • Unit price (RMB)
  • Total per item
  • Overall order summary

After the Excel file is generated:
- The user is redirected automatically to WhatsApp.
- The Excel file is sent directly to the official AL BURAQ WhatsApp number.
- The sales team receives the order instantly and contacts the client to finalize pricing, shipping, and confirmation.

This approach ensures flexibility, fast communication, and avoids online payment complexity, while keeping all orders structured and professional.
